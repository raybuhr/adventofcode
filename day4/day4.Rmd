--- Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases ---

A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a passphrase instead of simply a password. A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.

To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.

For example:

aa bb cc dd ee is valid.
aa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.
aa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.
The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. How many passphrases are valid?

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(purrr)
pws <- read_lines("day4/day4.txt")
```

```{r}
word_df <- data_frame(line = pws) %>% 
  mutate(words = map(line, strsplit, split = " ")) %>% 
  mutate(word_count = map_chr(words, unlist) %>% length())
```
